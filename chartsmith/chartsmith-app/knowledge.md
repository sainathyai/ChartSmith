# Hydration

- Use suppressHydrationWarning on elements where hydration mismatches are expected and harmless
- Always wrap dynamic date displays (toLocaleString, etc) with suppressHydrationWarning to prevent React hydration errors
- For dynamic content that differs between server and client, use useEffect to update the content after initial render
- Avoid using browser-only APIs in the initial render (window, document, etc)
- For dynamic content that differs between server and client, use useEffect to update the content after initial render
- Avoid using browser-only APIs in the initial render (window, document, etc)
- When using useSearchParams() in client components, wrap in Suspense boundary to prevent hydration errors
- For dynamic routes, wrap components using searchParams in Suspense to prevent hydration mismatches

# State Management

- Prefer using centralized state from contexts over local component state when data is shared
- Files and workspace data come from Centrifugo real-time updates - don't maintain duplicate state
- When optimistically creating messages:
  - Update both messages and workspace state together
  - Pass state setters through component chain to maintain consistency
  - Keep optimistic updates synchronized across related state
- Explorer follows new files automatically:
  - Selects most recently added or modified file
  - Tracks both workspace files and chart files
  - Updates selection on both new files and content changes
- Files have composite identity (id, revision_number) - maintain consistent IDs across revisions
- Use filePath property name to match backend naming convention
- Files are represented by WorkspaceFile interface, not DOM File type
- Always handle potentially undefined file paths from Centrifugo updates with default values
- Filter out invalid files (missing paths) from Centrifugo updates before processing
- When auto-selecting files, filter for valid files first to prevent runtime errors
- When handling real-time updates:
  - Always provide default values for required fields (e.g. isComplete: false)
  - Convert date strings to Date objects before updating state
  - Ensure all required properties are present in message and plan objects
  - When optimistically creating messages, match the server message shape exactly (e.g. 'prompt' vs 'content')
  - When optimistically creating related items (e.g. message and plan), use matching temp IDs
  - Update all relevant state (messages, workspace, etc) for complete optimistic UI

# React Patterns

- Never update state of a component during render of another component
- Move state updates that depend on prop/state changes into useEffect
- Use stable IDs as React keys when available to preserve component state during updates
- Always import UI components from @/components/ui/* to ensure consistent styling and behavior
- For real-time connections:
  - Use stable IDs as React keys when available to preserve component state during updates
  - Always import UI components from @/components/ui/* to ensure consistent styling and behavior
  - Wrap WebSocket message handlers in useCallback to prevent reconnections in production builds
  - Keep WebSocket effect dependencies minimal - only include values needed for connection setup

# Theme

# Layout

- Use min-w-[size] instead of w-[size] for fixed-width sections in flex layouts to prevent overflow
- Keep flex-1 on growing sections between fixed-width elements
- For nav bars with 3 sections (left, center, right), use min-width on outer sections to prevent squishing
- For chat bubbles:
    - Use truncate on text elements to prevent wrapping
    - Add min-w-0 to parent flex container to enable truncation
    - Make action buttons flex-shrink-0 to maintain size
    - Keep hover actions outside of text container
    - Fixed chat input at bottom only shows in editor mode (after first revision)
    - Chat input appears whenever there's a revision (currentRevisionNumber > 0), regardless of whether there are plans or not
- Chat input appears only in the most recent message bubble (plan or chat), never in multiple places
    - When determining most recent message:
      - Temp messages (msg-temp-*) are always newer than non-temp messages
      - Messages without dates are considered newer than messages with dates
      - Only compare dates when both messages have valid dates
      - When sorting messages:
        - Move temp messages and incomplete messages to bottom of list
        - Keep messages at bottom until both non-temp and complete
        - Sort messages chronologically within their groups (newest at bottom)
    - Messages and plans must be rendered in strict chronological order:
      - Sort plans by their first message's timestamp
      - Process plans in chronological order
      - Sort messages within each plan chronologically
      - Insert non-plan messages between plans based on their createdAt timestamp
      - Keep plan messages together but respect the overall chronological order
      - When sorting messages:
        - Move temp messages and incomplete messages to bottom of list
        - Keep messages at bottom until both non-temp and complete
        - Sort messages chronologically within their groups (newest at bottom)
      - When handling real-time updates:
        - Capture previous state before updates when needed for transition checks
        - Check state transitions to trigger side effects (e.g. refresh data)
        - Append unknown messages rather than ignoring them
        - When replacing optimistic items:
          - Match by workspace ID and temp ID prefix
          - Remove optimistic items when real ones arrive
          - Keep non-optimistic items during updates
          - Replace entire optimistic item rather than merging
    - Chat content needs padding to scroll above fixed input
    - Automatically expand parent folders when new files are added
    - Expand new chart nodes and their file paths automatically
    - Preserve user's manual expand/collapse state for existing folders
    
  - For file explorer items with hover actions:
  - Use truncate on text elements to prevent wrapping
  - Add min-w-0 to parent flex container to enable truncation
  - Make action buttons flex-shrink-0 to maintain size
  - Keep hover actions outside of text container

# File Tree Structure
- All files belong to the workspace's chart
- When receiving new files via real-time updates:
  - Add new files to the first chart in the workspace
  - Create folder structure based on file path segments
  - Auto-expand parent folders when new files are added
  - Files are only shown as children of their chart, never as standalone files
  - Use truncate on text elements to prevent wrapping
  - Add min-w-0 to parent flex container to enable truncation
  - Make action buttons flex-shrink-0 to maintain size
  - Keep hover actions outside of text container
  - For table rows with hover actions:
    - Keep action buttons always visible unless explicitly required to be hidden
    - Add cursor-pointer to action buttons
    - Use consistent padding and icon sizes
    - Maintain hover states for background and text color

  - For collapsible content:
    - Auto-collapse content when it becomes less relevant (e.g. superseded plans)
    - Use line-clamp-2 for collapsed preview
    - Position expand/collapse buttons in top-right
    - Maintain collapsed state until user explicitly expands
    - For action files:
      - Show count summary in header
      - Auto-expand during applying state
      - Auto-collapse in applied state
      - Use smooth height transition with max-h-[500px]
      - When scrolling to expanded content with many items:
        - Use multiple delayed scrolls (100ms, 200ms, 300ms)
        - Match transition duration (300ms) with scroll timing
        - Ensure max height can accommodate typical content

  - Plan workflow states:
    - planning: Initial state for new plans, no actions shown
    - pending: Intermediate state, no actions shown
    - applying: Showing action files, no actions shown
    - applied: Showing action files
    - review: Show approve/reject actions and chat input
    - ignored: Collapsed view
    - In editor view: only show proceed/feedback actions in review state
    - In editor view: show linear progress indicator during planning/applying states
    - In plan-only view: show proceed/feedback actions in review state
    - When creating new plans, mark other plans as ignored directly in workspace state
  - For file explorer panels:
    - Use fixed width w-[280px] consistently across nested containers
    - Use flex-shrink-0 to prevent resizing
    - Wrap tree in fixed-width container to maintain consistent width
    - Add min-w-0 to content area to enable truncation
  - For table rows with hover actions:
    - Keep action buttons always visible unless explicitly required to be hidden
    - Add cursor-pointer to action buttons
    - Use consistent padding and icon sizes
    - Maintain hover states for background and text color
- For full-height scrollable containers:
  - Use h-[calc(100vh-3.5rem)] for containers below nav bar (3.5rem is nav height)
  - Use h-full with overflow-auto on parent and py-8 on child for padding
  - Add min-h-0 to prevent flex children from expanding beyond parent
  - For centered single-card layouts:
    - Use max-w-3xl with mx-auto for consistent width
    - Add px-4 for mobile padding
    - Use border-dark-border/40 for subtle card borders
    - Add pb-16 for bottom spacing
  - For mobile viewport height:
    - Set CSS variable --vh using window.innerHeight * 0.01
    - Update on window resize
    - Use calc(var(--vh, 1vh) * 100) for full height
- For layout transitions between states, add transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out to parent containers
- For transitions between centered and side-aligned layouts:
  - Use absolute positioning with inset-0 for centered state
  - Use left-0 top-0 bottom-0 for side-aligned state
  - Add padding to centered container, not wrapper
  - Avoid nested flex containers during transition
  - Keep max-width and padding only in centered state
  - Use exact width (e.g. w-[400px]) without padding in side-aligned state
  - Use same container structure in both states to ensure smooth transitions
  - Maintain consistent chat container wrapper with absolute positioning
- For smooth width transitions in flex layouts:
  - Use flex-shrink-0 instead of flex-none
  - Add transitions to both parent and child containers
  - Maintain consistent transition properties (duration and timing function)
  - For sequenced transitions, use longer duration (500ms) and transitionDelay on second element
  - For major layout transitions, consider mounting second element after delay rather than transitioning opacity
  - For sequenced transitions, use useState + useEffect with setTimeout instead of CSS transition-delay
  - For sequenced transitions, use transitionend event to trigger next animation instead of fixed delays
  - For major layout transitions, consider mounting second element after delay rather than transitioning opacity
  - When transitioning between layouts, update all related UI state (e.g. sidebar visibility) before starting transition
- Don't reset loading states when redirecting to a new page, only reset on error

# Database

- When scanning pgvector columns into Go slices, cast vector to float[] with `column::float[]`
- Vector similarity searches use `<=>` operator
- Vectors are stored in native pgvector format but must be cast when scanning to application
- For array parameters with pgx, use `&pgtype.Array[T]{Elements: slice, Valid: true}`
- workspace_file table uses composite primary key (id, revision_number) - maintain same id across revisions

# Theme colors:

Light theme:
- Background: #ffffff (bg-light)
- Surface: #f1f5f9 (bg-light-surface)
- Border: #e2e8f0 (border-light-border)
- Text: #0f172a (text-slate-900)

Button styling:
- Primary buttons: bg-primary with text-white for contrast
- Secondary/outline buttons: Use theme-aware hover states

Message styling:
- Regular chat messages: bg-dark-border/40 (dark) or bg-gray-100 (light)
- User messages: bg-primary/20 with rounded-tr-sm and text-gray-200 (dark) or bg-primary/10 with text-gray-700 (light)
- Assistant messages: bg-dark-border/40 with text-gray-200 and label text-gray-400 (dark) or bg-gray-100 with text-gray-700 and label text-gray-500 (light)
- Plan messages: bg-dark-border/40 (dark) or bg-gray-100 (light) with rounded-tl-sm and "Proposed Plan" label

Dark theme:
- Background: #0f0f0f (bg-dark)
- Surface: #1a1a1a (bg-dark-surface)
- Border: #2f2f2f (border-dark-border)
- Text: #ffffff (text-white)

Usage:
- Use bg-dark for main page backgrounds
- Use bg-dark-surface for elevated surfaces like cards, inputs, dropdowns
- Use border-dark-border for borders and dividers
- Maintain strong contrast between layers in dark mode
- Use opacity modifiers (e.g. border-dark-border/40) for subtle borders
- Add extra padding at page bottom (pb-16) for better mobile spacing

Persistence:
- Theme preference is stored in 'theme' cookie
- Theme cookie is cleared on logout
- Default theme is dark

Hydration:
- Use suppressHydrationWarning on elements where hydration mismatches are expected and harmless (e.g. testing attributes, timestamps)
- For dynamic content that differs between server and client, use useEffect to update the content after initial render
- Avoid using browser-only APIs in the initial render (window, document, etc)
- Prevent theme flash by setting both classList and color-scheme in inline script before React hydration
- Use :root[class='theme'] for better CSS specificity than :root.theme

React Hooks:
- Call hooks at the top level of component
- Don't call hooks inside conditionals, loops, or nested functions
- Extract values from hooks before using in JSX conditionals
- For useEffect dependencies:
  - Include all variables used inside the effect
  - For resize event listeners, empty array is acceptable since they don't depend on props/state
  - For real-time connections, include connection parameters (workspaceId, etc.)

# Development & Deployment

- Do not run npm run dev - custom dev setup in place
- Tailwind plugins used in the application (like @tailwindcss/typography) should be regular dependencies, not devDependencies
- PostCSS plugins (like autoprefixer) should be regular dependencies since they're used in production builds
- Run lint/type checks before committing, not after every small change
- For small changes that are obviously correct, skip the checks
- Run full build before deploying or when making significant changes
- Hide dev indicators in next.config.ts with devIndicators: { buildActivity: false, buildActivityPosition: "bottom-right", appIsrStatus: false }

- Session expiration is extended on user activity (mouse, keyboard, scroll, touch)
- Activity events are debounced to prevent excessive database updates
- Session extension happens server-side via extendSessionAction action

# Editor Configuration
- Monaco editor padding only accepts 'top' and 'bottom' in IEditorPaddingOptions
- Use padding: { top: 8, bottom: 8 } for consistent editor padding
