# Contributing

This doc is a development guide for how engineers can contribute to this project.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- macOS
- Docker Desktop
- Go 1.24 or later
- Node.js 18 and nvm 
- npm
- [Schemahero](https://schemahero.io/docs/installation/) (must rename the binary to `schemahero` and put on path)
- A SQL DB editor available. Confider Beekeeper Studio if you don't already have one available

### Required Secrets

Before starting, ensure you have the following secrets configured locally on your computer (you can copy `env.development.example` to `.env` in the repo root and fill the values in there—these values are now picked up automatically when you run `make run-worker`, `make bootstrap`, etc.):

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Get your own key (Create a new API key in Anthropic Console)
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: Get your own key (Get a new API key from groq.com)
- `VOYAGE_API_KEY`: Get your own key (Generate new key)
- `CHARTSMITH_PG_URI=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/chartsmith?sslmode=disable`
- `CHARTSMITH_CENTRIFUGO_ADDRESS=http://localhost:8000/api`
- `CHARTSMITH_CENTRIFUGO_API_KEY=api_key` (Already set)
- `CHARTSMITH_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION=` (Can ignore)
- `CHARTSMITH_SLACK_TOKEN=` (Can ignore)
- `CHARTSMITH_SLACK_CHANNEL=` (Can ignore)

You should also create a .env.local file in the `chartsmith-app` directory with some of the same content. You will update this with your Anthropic API key, and your Google Client secret information.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=730758876435-8v7frmnqtt7k7v65edpc6u3hso9olqbe.apps.googleusercontent.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/google
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<get from 1password>
HMAC_SECRET=not-secure
CENTRIFUGO_TOKEN_HMAC_SECRET=change.me
NEXT_PUBLIC_CENTRIFUGO_ADDRESS=ws://localhost:8000/connection/websocket
TOKEN_ENCRYPTION=H5984PaaBSbFZTMKjHiqshqRCG4dg49JAs0dDdLbvEs=
NEXT_PUBLIC_REPLICATED_REDIRECT_URI=https://vendor-web-<youruser>.okteto.repldev.com/chartsmith-login?redirect_uri=https://chartsmith-app-<youruser>.okteto.repldev.com/auth/replicated
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000/api

```

### Setup Steps

1. **Start the Development Environment**

   ```bash
   cd hack/chartsmith-dev
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Open Four Terminal Windows**

   You'll need to run multiple services simultaneously. Open four separate terminal windows and navigate to the project root in each.

3. **Terminal 1: Frontend Development**
   ```bash
   cd chartsmith-app
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts the frontend development server.

4. **Terminal 2: Backend Worker**
   ```bash
   make run-worker
   ```
   This runs the backend worker service.

5. **Terminal 3: Database Schema**
   ```bash
   make schema
   ```
   This deploys the Schemahero migrations to set up the database schema.

6. **Terminal 4: Bootstrap Chart Data**
   ```bash
   make bootstrap
   ```
   This is a **critical step** that initializes the chart data in the database. Without this step, the application won't have the necessary template data to function properly.

7. **Admin Access**
   
   The first user to log in will automatically be granted admin privileges and bypass the waitlist.
   You can log in at: http://localhost:3000/login?test-auth=true

8. **Terminal 5: Claude Integration (optional)**
   ```bash
   # Use Claude for development assistance
   ```

### Additional Commands

- To rebuild the worker:
  ```bash
  make run-worker
  ```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure Docker is running and all containers are up
2. Verify all required secrets are properly configured
3. Check that Schemahero is installed and accessible in your PATH
4. Make sure all dependencies are installed (both Go and npm packages)
5. If you get an error `ERROR: type "vector" does not exist` when running `make schema`, you can manually enable the PGVector extension:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it chartsmith-dev-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d chartsmith -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"
   ```
   Or simply run the Make target that handles this:
   ```bash
   make pgvector
   ```
   After enabling the extension, run `make schema` again (though it now automatically runs the pgvector target as a prerequisite).

### Development Workflow

1. Make changes to the code
2. The frontend will automatically reload with changes
3. The worker will need to be restarted if you make backend changes
4. Use Claude for code assistance and development guidance

### Notes

- The development environment uses PostgreSQL running in Docker
- Schemahero is used for database migrations
- The frontend runs on the default Next.js port
- The worker runs on a separate process

## VS Code Extension Development

For detailed instructions on developing the VS Code extension, see [chartsmith-extension/DEVELOPMENT.md](chartsmith-extension/DEVELOPMENT.md). 

This guide covers:
- Building and installing the extension from a VSIX file
- Configuring endpoints for local development
- Enabling development mode
- Debugging with the developer console
- Testing extension features with built-in commands

## Release

All releases are automated using various Dagger functions.


The validate function will run all the tests and linting checks.

```
make release version=[patch|minor|major]
```

The release function will create a new release tag and push all container images to the appropriate registries and the K8s manifests to gitops repo.
